Thanks for the great job, [s12wu](https://github.com/s12wu)!
Your code and wiring scheme really helped me out to reuse the keyboard of an antique Fujitsu Siemens Amilo Pro with a Belgian AZERTY keyboard.

I used the version without the expander, and I also made some code changes to facilitate the use of NumLock as marked on the keyboard keys. (The keyboard does not have a dedicated numeric keypad.)
This was my first project involving soldering. So, it was a journey of failing and learning. :)

## The first test setup
I used this setup to figure out the keycodes and test the keys after configuration.
